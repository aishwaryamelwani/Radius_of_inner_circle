# Circle Radius Calculator:
This Python script calculates the radius of the inner circle formed by the intersection of two circles represented by equations of the form:
*a * x^2 + b * y^2 = c*

# USAGE:
**Clone or download the repository to your local machine.**

**Navigate to the directory where the program is located.**

**Run the program using a Python interpreter**:
1. Copy code
2. python circle_radius_calculator.py
3. Follow the prompts to input the coefficients a, b, and the constant term c of the circle equations.
4. The script will then output the radius of the inner circle.

# EXAMPLE:
`Enter the coefficient of x^2 (a): 1
Enter the coefficient of y^2 (b): 1
Enter the constant term (c): 1`
# OUTPUT:
`The radius of the inner circle is approximately 0.2500`
